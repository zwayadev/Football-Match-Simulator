Football Match Simulator by zwayadev

Football Match Simulator is a open-source free program that simulates football matches of your favourite real or fictional football teams.

**Warning: THIS PROGRAM ISN'T A VIRUS! WINDOWS USUALLY DETECTS IT AS VIRUS BECAUSE IT'S A CONSOLE PROGRAM! If you don't trust me download at your own risk**

**HOW TO USE:**

1) After you open the program you will have to enter names of your teams that are playing
2) Press enter and VIOLA! The match is starting!

   **YOU MUST KEEP allmatches.txt and lastmatch.txt in the same folder as the .exe otherwise the program might crash upon completion**


*Explanation of the program:*
--------------------------------------------------------
"=============================="      
||TEAM 1 0 - 0 TEAM 2 || 0:00 ||           
"=============================="            
 //TEAM 1/TEAM 2 = *Names of teams* | 0-0 = *Current result*
//0:00 = *Current time*
---------------------------------------------------------
Some text under that refreshes every minute 
//*Match event*
It might even be 2 lines long               
//*Match commentary*
Wow now it's 3 lines  
//*Sometimes it gets interesting*
